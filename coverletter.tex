Dear Sir/Madam
\end{flushleft}
I am writing in response to your advertised internship position at Facebook in 2012.

I am a fourth year student in Trinity College Dublin studying Computer Science, and expect to graduate from my undergraduate degree course in the summer of 2012 with a I.I. I then plan to go on a pursue a masters in computer science.\\
I am particularly interested in the advertised post because I would love to work for one of the most successful companies in the I.T. industry. To me Facebook seems to be one of the most innovative companies in the industry. I would very much like to be a part of such an organization.\\
I feel I am suited to the position because I have very good teamwork, communication and presentation skills. I spent the previous summer working for IBM, which helped develop these skills greatly. In addition I have very good technical skills as outlined in my curriculum vitae. I more than meet all of the requirements outlined. I am based in Dublin but moving around the country is not a problem for me.

I have enclosed my curriculum vitae. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.\\*

Yours faithfully\\\vspace{10mm}
