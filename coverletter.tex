Dear Sir/Madam
\end{flushleft}

I am writing in response to your advertised Graduate Software Engineering position at Citrix Ireland. I meet a Citrix employee, Lindsay Munns, at the recent Career Zoo event in Dublin. He told me a bit about Citrix and strongly recommended I apply as I would be a good fit for a number of roles.

I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in November 2013 with a Masters in Computer Science and a first class honors B.A.Mod in Computer Science. I have interned in MasterCard and IBM. Since graduating I have spent my time traveling and working part time.

I am particularly interested in the advertised post because I would love to work for one of the most successful companies in the I.T. industry. I also have a keen interest in mobile development and visualization technologies and would like build my career in this area.

I have a lot of experience writing Java code in a production environment and consider myself very proficient in its use. I also have a good amount of experience in Python, SQL, C/C++, JavaScript, Objective-C and Android development among others. I have completed large projects using each of these languages, both personal and at university. 

I feel I am suited to the position because I have very good teamwork, communication and presentation skills. In addition I have very good technical skills as outlined in my curriculum vitae. I more than meet all of the requirements outlined.

I have enclosed my curriculum vitae. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.\\*
