Dear Sir/Madam
\end{flushleft}

I am writing in response to your advertised Graduate Software Engineering position at Intel Ireland.

I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in November 2013 with a Masters in Computer Science and a first class honors B.A.Mod in Computer Science. I have interned in MasterCard and IBM. Since graduating I have spent my time traveling and working part time.

I am particularly interested in the advertised post because I would love to work for one of the most successful companies in the I.T. industry and to work with embedded systems.

I have a lot of experience writing Java code in a production environment and consider myself very proficient in its use. I also have a good amount of experience in Python, SQL, C/C++, JavaScript, Objective-C and Android development among others. I have completed large projects using each of these languages, both personal and at university. I have a keen interest in embedded system development. Both my masters and degree program had several modules related to embedded development all of which I elected to take. These ranged from low level C programming, SSE programming, VHDL and ARM development. These courses were among my favorites and I would like to continue to work with embedded systems.

I feel I am suited to the position because I have very good teamwork, communication and presentation skills. In addition I have very good technical skills as outlined in my curriculum vitae. I more than meet all of the requirements outlined.

I have enclosed my curriculum vitae. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.\\*
