Dear Sir/Madam
\end{flushleft}
I am writing in response to your advertised Graduate Software Engineer position at Pinterest.

I graduated from Trinity College Dublin in November 2013 with a Masters in Computer Science and a first class honors B.A.Mod in Computer Science. I have interned in MasterCard and IBM. Since graduating I have spent my time traveling and working part time.

I am particularly interested in the advertised post because I would like to work for a successful energetic company in San Francisco. I have a lot of experience writing Java code in a production environment and consider myself very proficient in its use. I also have a good amount of experience in Python, SQL, C/C++, JavaScript, Objective-C and Android development among others. I have completed large projects using each of these languages, both personal and at university. I have an interest in big data and would like to tackle interesting problems for a living.
I feel I am suited to the position because I have very good teamwork, communication and presentation skills. In addition I have very good technical skills as outlined in my curriculum vitae. I more than meet all of the requirements outlined.
\\*

As I graduated in early November last year I am eligible for a one year graduate work visa. They do not require sponsorship to obtain and usually take 6 weeks to process.

I have enclosed my curriculum vitae. If you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to hearing from you.\\*
