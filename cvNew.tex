    \item{{\bf Masters Thesis, 2013}} Thesis title: Browser Based Categorization of Data Towards Automated Visualization, attempted to create a system to automatically visualize an arbitrary dataset. The system generated visualizations using only the input data. No additional meta-data was required. Overall it was determined that such a system can be effective at creating useful visualizations, but its effectiveness diminishes as the data becomes more complex.\\


    \item{{\bf MasterCard Ireland, 2012}} Seven month internship as part of degree program. Worked as part of the InControl team. Primarily responsible for maintaining and updating a testing tool used by QA to interface with the InControl service to test it. Worked closely with both the InControl development team and QA team. Gained valuable experience with the entire technology stack, as well as communication skills working with many different people and teams at once. The technologies used were Java and Oracle SQL and Spring.\\
   
     
    \item{{\bf IBM Ireland, 2011}} Summer internship for 3 months at IBM Ireland as part of their Extreme Blue internship program. Worked on a mobile web application as part of a team of four. The project was voted second out of over twenty at the end of the internship. As well as creating the application weekly update presentations were given to managers and co-workers. Developed skills in computer programming, teamwork, and communication with management and architects in order to design and plan the project, in addition to making sure the project was on track and mile-stones were being met.\\
    
 
    \item{{\bf GeSCI, 2010}} Co-developed open-source software to assist with the calculation of ICT costs across a country. The software is now deployed in several Ministry's of Education across Africa. Developed skills in computer programming and teamwork. Attended meetings with the client in order to ensure what was being built fit the requirements. Developed skills in translating user requirements into a final design for implementation.\\

    \item{{\bf Dangerous Goods Safety Advisor, 2010 - Present}} Responsible for ensuring that three organizations adhere to the requirements set out by the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road. Notable aspects include inspection of sites to ensure regulations are being adhered too, consultation with the organizations if regulations are not being met and the submission of an annual report to the HSA.
